## RUNNING

- If you wish to run the application uninstalled, execute;

  ./gnome-tweaks [-p /path/to/jhbuild/prefix/]

## SUPPORTED DESKTOPS

Tweaks is designed for GNOME Shell but can be used in other desktops.
A few features will be missing when Tweaks is run on a different desktop.

## TODO

- I'm not sure if the TweakGroup layer is necessary, and it makes
  it hard to categorise things. Perhaps go to a named factory approach
- Do some more things lazily to improve startup speed
