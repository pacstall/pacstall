# CMatrix

CMatrix is based on the screensaver from The Matrix website. It shows text
flying in and out in a terminal like as seen in "The Matrix" movie. It can
scroll lines all at the same rate or asynchronously and at a user-defined
speed.

CMatrix by default operates in **eye candy** mode. It must be aborted with
control-c (Ctrl+C) or by pressing q. If you wish for more of a screen saver
effect, you must specify `-s` on the command line. For usage info, use `cmatrix -h`.

### Dependencies

You'll probably need a decent ncurses library (or PDCurses on native Windows) to get this to work.

### Building and installing cmatrix

To install cmatrix, use either of the following methods from within the cmatrix directory.

#### Using `configure` (recommended for most linux user)

```
autoreconf -i  # skip if using released tarball
./configure
make
make install
```

#### Using CMake

Here we also show an out-of-source build in the sub directory "build".
Don't use CMake if you want to use PDCurses, it won't work (for now).

```
mkdir -p build
cd build
# to install to "/usr/local"
cmake ..
# or to install to "/usr"
#cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..
make
make install
```

### Running cmatrix

After you have installed cmatrix just run `cmatrix` to run cmatrix :)

_To get the program to look most like the movie, use `cmatrix -lba`_
_To get the program to look most like the Win/Mac screensaver, use `cmatrix -ol`_

### Valuable information

If you have any suggestions/flames/patches to send, please feel free to
open issues and if possible solve them in PRs via Github.

_Note: cmatrix is probably not particularly portable or efficient, but it wont hog
**too** much CPU time_
