This is my attempt at making a universal package manager without having them in containers like snap, flathub and appimage. How I can make it universal is by compiling from source. Your first question is probably, wait, what about dependencies? Well, pacstall is very modular. How I made it modular is by making the process of installing packages convoluted. There's an install.sh file. There's a depends.sh file. There's an alerts.sh file. You get the point, it's modular.
Currently, most bigger sized packages only have apt install in their respective depends.sh file, but I hope to add more support for rpm distro's. I don't plan on adding much support for Arch because it has the AUR.
