This is the branch directory where you can put a package in a certain branch. Look below for where you can put your package.


## Community
* This is the AUR equivalent for pacstall. Anything* will be accepted in a pull request.

## Unstable
* Everything that hasn't been tested yet. Don't put anything in this branch unless its seriously dangerous to run and needs extensive testing.

## Testing
* Basically the Unstable branch but doesn't need extensive testing.
* Put packages here when you want them to be tested before putting into the /pacstall/packages directory.

## HOMA
* Anything that's hit or miss installing, that work and could be considered stable, but install correctly sometimes. They will be tested until they work properly, but knock yourself out installing from this branch


---
*As long as it installs
