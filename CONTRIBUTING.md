* Make it meaningful
Don't make a random flag that serves edge cases, make flags that can be used by many people

* Make it functional
I know my code can be sloppy (working on it), but please document code. If your code is a big function, put it in misc/scripts/ and source it from a flag in pacstall. If it is small it can stay in the pacstall file
